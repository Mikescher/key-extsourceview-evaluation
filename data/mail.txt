Hello all,

As a part of my Master's thesis, I have developed a prototype for an extended source code view in KeY.
This prototype displays additional information from the sequent in the "Source" window.

I am looking for participants for a brief (30-45 minutes), non-anonymous survey on this topic. 
For this, you would need to verify two programs, one with the new prototype and one only with the sequent view. 
Uring the evaluation you sould need to fill out a questionnaire about it.

I would appreciate your participation, the files and instructions can be found at https://mikescher.github.io/key-extsourceview-evaluation/.

The duration of the evaluation is from 2023-03-13 until 2023-03-20.
Please send the filled out questionaires to me ( ugxvv@student.kit.edu ) before the end date.

Best regards,
Mike Schw√∂rer
